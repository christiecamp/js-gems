# M4 CHALLENGE - Web APIs: Code Quiz

## My Task

Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## User Story

**AS A** coding boot camp student

**I WANT** to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

**SO THAT** I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


## Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** I am taking a code quiz

**WHEN** I click the start button

**THEN** a timer starts and I am presented with a question

**WHEN** I answer a question

**THEN** I am presented with another question

**WHEN** I answer a question incorrectly

**THEN** time is subtracted from the clock

**WHEN** all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

**THEN** the game is over

**WHEN** the game is over

**THEN** I can save my initials and my score

## Mock-Up
